# Trivia Quiz

![Trivia Quiz](readme/amiresponsive.png)

Trivia Quiz is a quiz app build to attract all categories of users by providing them with different categories and modern design, [see Credit for inspiration](#credit). The reason behind having a modern design is simply because you can implement this app in any future website to attract more visitors and also for them to have some fun by enjoying a quiz.

## Table of Contents

- ### UX:

  - #### User stories

    I.	First Time Visitor Goals:

    - I would like to have the option to select a quiz from various categories.

    - If the quiz is finished, I would like to have the option to restart the quiz immediately without having to return to the main menu.

    - I want a quiz with different scores results, depending on how well I have done on the quiz.

    - I want to find links to social media to find updates on the trivia-quizzes.

    II.	Returning User Goals:

    - When I return to the website, I want to receive new questions for the quizzes. 

    - Be able to see my previous scores for each quiz that I take.

    III.	Site Owner Goals:

    - Create a fun and friendly website where the users can enjoy having a quiz.

    - Let users have the option to select the quiz from various categories.

    - Let users be able to contact the site owner by email for any recommendation of different quizzes or improvements of any kind.


 - #### Strategy

    - The strategy for having a quiz website is to attract all categories of users and provide them with various categories of quizzes. Thru these quizzes, I want to offer the users an enjoyable and challenging experience each day.

  - #### Structure

    - ##### Features: 

        Responsive on all screen devices.

      - ##### Existing Features:
    
        The website it's structure on three pages. 

        1. Home Page 

          - The logo of Trivia Quiz will take the user to the Home page.
          
          - Landing section - Where the user can take a random quiz or go to the Quiz Category section or Contact section from the navigation menu.

          - Quiz Category section - Where users can select a quiz from different categories. 

          - Contact section - Where users can contact the site owner by email for any recommendation of different quizzes or improvements of any kind. 

          - On the footer of the website, the users can find links to social media to follow for more updates on the Trivia Quiz app.

        2. Game Page 

          - At first, the user has a choice to start the quiz or to view the previous high score if any

          - When starting the quiz the questions are pull from Open Trivia DB API and displayed one by one with a countdown timer

          - When the quiz is finished, the user will see its score on a popup modal from where he can select to play again the quiz or return to the home page to select a different category.

        3. 404 Page

          - 404 Page was added in case users redirect to a page that does not exist. 
 
      - ##### Future Features to Implement:

        - Provide users with a menu to select the number of questions and level of difficulty before starting the actual quiz 

        - Provide the user with a save menu when the quiz is complete, so that will allow them to use different names for each time they take a quiz if they want to have a more explicit history of a high score, instead of having just the higher score saved each time for the quiz that was played.

- #### Surface

    -  ##### Colour Scheme

        - Palette:

            ![Palette Colors](readme/palette-colors.jpg) 

            - The color was selected from palette colors and for this quiz app, I went with a palette of light and warm colors.

    -  ##### Typography

        - For the consistency of the quiz theme I chose one font-family PT Serif.

    -  ##### Imagery

        - Because imagery is important I have carefully chosen a light background hero image that will go with the quiz theme.

    2. Once the project was created I rename it from the settings 

        ![](readme/remane-project-from-settings.png)

    3. When the repository was finally completed I open the project with [Gitpod](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki?hl=en) in Chrome browser

    4. In order to push this project from Gitpod on Github a set of commands were used:

        ```
        - git status  - Check the status of the repository and see if there were any changes in files 

        - git add .  - Add the files that were modified/created, so we can commit it 

        - git commit -m "message for commit"  - Commits all the changes

        - git push  - Pushes all committed versions to Github
        ```

  - #### GitHub Pages
