- ### Bugs and Fixs

    - Internet Explorer: When press "Let's start this quiz" the quiz game wouldn't start.

        - In game.js, validateAnswer function was used "for (let of)" that was no support in Internet Explorer. 

        - To fix: the "for (let of)" loop was replaced with the "for" loop and the quiz game could start.

    - Internet Explorer: After the user selected an answer from the possible options, he couldn't see the background color of the selected answer of correct or wrong class because the hover background color was still visible.

        - To fix this in game.css was added another rule and the class of correct and wrong was added to selector with pseudo-class hover to have the background of the correct and wrong class wants its added

    - Internet Explorer: After adding the updateTimeLeft function the quiz game didn't start

        - In the updateTimeLeft function was use template literals that are not supported in IE.

        - To fix this concatenation was used instead.

    - Internet Explorer: After adding a check on the redirected link from index.html to game.html the quiz game wouldn't start
    
        - The includes() method was used to check selected category from the URL and if the query string is not changed as well. The includes() method is not supported in IE.

        - To fix this the includes() method was changed with indexOf().

    - An Uncaught TypeError: error was shown in console.log after implement of "error message function" 

        - The error was happing because in the case of failed to parse the data from API call with JSON.parse the "error" object was send to the implemented function and from there was access to the name of the error. But if the API status call was not 200 no object could be sent thus resulting in an error.

        - To fix this the "error . name" was sent from the function that was making the API call instead of the object.

    - Wrong message displayed at the finish of the quiz when the score was shown.

        - To fix this the logical AND operator (&&) was used.
